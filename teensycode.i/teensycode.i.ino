/*
 * LED BEHAVIOR:
 * STARTUP: Blinks "THAWNEY LTD FSR BOARD" in morse code (one time on power-up)
 * OPERATION: LED strobes at different speeds based on maximum sensor value:
 *   - 0.0 - 0.1: LED OFF (no activity)
 *   - 0.1 - 0.3: SLOW strobe (500ms intervals)
 *   - 0.3 - 0.5: MEDIUM strobe (250ms intervals)  
 *   - 0.5 - 0.7: FAST strobe (100ms intervals)
 *   - 0.7 - 1.0: VERY FAST strobe (50ms intervals)
 * - Uses highest sensor value to determine strobe speed
 * - Provides progressive visual feedback of sensor pressure
 * - Minimal performance impact on serial speed
 * 
 * MORSE CODE TIMING (FAST SPEED):
 * - Dot: 40ms, Dash: 120ms, Gap: 40ms
 * - Letter gap: 120ms, Word gap: 280ms
 * - Standard morse code timing ratios (1:3:7) at 4x speed
 * 
 * SPEED OPTIMIZATIONS APPLIED:
 * - 2 Mbaud serial rate for high throughput
 * - 4x ADC averaging for stable readings with good speed
 * - No delays in main loop
 * - Minimal serial output overhead
 * - LED strobing uses efficient millis() timing (microseconds overhead)
 * 
 * EXPECTED PERFORMANCE:
 * - Teensy 4.x: ~800-1500 Hz update rate (with 4x averaging)
 * - Teensy 3.x: ~400-800 Hz update rate (with 4x averaging)
 * - Limited mainly by serial transmission time
 * - LED strobing adds <0.1% performance overhead
 * 
 * WIRING NOTES:
 * 
 * FSR Connection (typical setup):
 * - One side of FSR to analog pin
 * - Other side of FSR to +3.3V
 * - 10kÎ© pull-down resistor from analog pin to GND
 * 
 * LED: Built-in LED on pin 13 (no external wiring needed)
 * 
 * Teensy 4.0/4.1 Analog Pins:
 * A0-A9 are dedicated analog pins
 * A10-A13 are shared with digital pins 24-27
 * A14-A17 are available on some models
 * 
 * For Teensy 3.2:
 * - Change adcResolution to 1023
 * - Remove analogReadResolution() and analogReadAveraging() lines
 * 
 * SERIAL OUTPUT FORMAT:
 * Each line contains 16 comma-separated values from 0.00 to 1.00
 * Example: 0.23,0.00,0.87,0.45,0.00,0.12,0.99,0.00,0.34,0.67,0.00,0.78,0.23,0.45,0.89,0.12
 * 
 * CUSTOMIZATION:
 * - Adjust thresholds[] array to change sensitivity levels
 * - Modify strobeIntervals[] array to change strobe speeds
 * - LED responds progressively to maximum sensor pressure
 * - Add more threshold levels for finer control
